# Wasserstoff Backend Task

## Overview
Welcome to the Wasserstoff Backend Task repository! This project involves the development of an intelligent load balancer for multi-API management. It is divided into two milestones focusing on design and functionality, as well as queue management and analysis.


## Features
- **Dynamic Routing:** Routes incoming requests to different API endpoints based on various criteria.
- **Function Simulation:** Mock API endpoints with varied response times and behaviors.
- **Logging and Metrics:** Captures and logs metrics such as request times and endpoint selection.
- **Queue Management:** Implements different types of queues (FIFO, priority-based, round-robin) for request distribution.
- **Performance Analysis:** Provides detailed logs and metrics for each queuing strategy.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the server using `npm start`.
4. Access endpoints using Postman or any HTTP client.
